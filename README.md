## Description

 <!-- When creating a team, there's always certain roles that need to be filled. I utilized OOP (Object Oriented Programming) to create a team. OOP is extremely helpful, because it uses the DRY method, also known as 'Don't Repeat Yourself'. This basically means that duplicate code isn't created. For the team created, the following positions were filled: Manager, Engineer and Intern. Each position had similiar information that needed to be filled out, like:

 * Name
 * Role 
 * Id 
 * Email -->

 <!-- However, there were also a few differences. For a manager, the office number had to be displayed, whereas for engineers, their GitHubs had to be shared. The only other item that was needed for the intern, was the name of their school. To see the steps I've taken within the terminal, please continue to read along, as well as watch my [step-by-step video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nTy6C21mEpzGbNvzeZGTgC4rYGcDgzL4/view). I hope you enjoy and learn something new!  -->

## Usage

<!-- I used jest to run tests in order to see if the expected result is received. If it's successful, it will show that the suite or tests passed. If they did not pass, it will show the user the following information:
* The test that failed,
* The expected result versus the result that was actually received and, 
* A hint as to what needs to be fixed within the test.  -->
